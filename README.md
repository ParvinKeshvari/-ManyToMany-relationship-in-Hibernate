👩‍💻 About Me : 👋 Hi, I’m @ParvinKeshvari.

In a relational database, any number of rows of one entity can be referred to any number of rows of another entity. I write a simple project on how the @ManyToMany annotation can be used for specifying this type of relationship in Hibernate. In this example, we create a Multi-To-Many relationship between the user, Role, and Permission tables so that we have different Role for each user and different Permission for different Roles, and thus multiple Permission for users
